# productivity-calendar
Chrome extension that tracks how much the user works every day. Replaces the default new tab screen (Google Search).

The darker the hue of the day, the more the user has worked that day. The user can hover over a particular day to see the amount of time worked on that day in HH:MM:SS:

Clicking the start work button starts the timer and will add time to the current day after it is pressed again:
